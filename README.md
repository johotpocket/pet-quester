# PET-QUESTER

You pet pets or something, I dunno. It's an adventure, we'll figure it out!

----
## To start project
- Forked initial repository from project partner(johotpocket)
- Cloned repo from my github:
`git clone https://github.com/tdicomitis/pet-quester.git`
- Opened in atom

## Clean up
- Cleaned up and deleted files we would not need (logo.svg)
- Removed any imports of files we did not need

## Project preparation
Made wireframe of what our pages would look like:
- Splash page
- Login/Signup pages, choose avatar for game
- Story/Instructions page
- General layout of game play page

----

# Building the game
Now that we both have access to the repo, we will begin to create our game and divide tasks. Will co-partner on coding and split if we need to (one works on front-end the other works on back-end).

### Creating the Home page
- First, made a new folder in  `src` named `Containers` to keep things neat
- Next, made a new file in `Containers` named `HomePage.js` where I will design our home page
