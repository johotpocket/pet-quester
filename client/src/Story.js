        <p> No memories of before, no memory of who you are... you awake with only the clothes on your back
        and a vague sense of unease. As your eyes focus to the dim candle-lit light, you take in your surroundings.
        A comfy but simple and old looking couch is underneath you, and stone walls surround you in a small room.
        A large oak door is opposite to you.
        Sunlight streamsthrough a small open window, and small birds can be heard chirping away. You glimpse the tops of
        trees outside, too.
        </p>
